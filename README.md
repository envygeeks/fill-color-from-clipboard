# Fill Color From Clipboard

Fill color from clipboard allows you to clip a color from your pallet, without a symbol pallet, and to paste it into a layer.  This allows you to quickly change your icons before creating a symbol set, or to find colors online that you like, copy the hex, and paste it into your selected layer.
